# HW7

### Question 1 (13 points)
Building off the exercise from Lecture 15 and HW 6. Use the test and training set from the Seattle housing dataset defined in Lecture 15. Then compare predictions from the two models in lecture and your model with spatial structure from HW 6.

### Question 2 (12 points)
Also using the Seattle housing dataset, construct a binary variable to denote whether a house costs more than $600,000. Fit a generalized spatial regression model. Include some discussion of the effect of the covariates on the response and how they differ (or not) from a naive logistic regression model using `glm`.
